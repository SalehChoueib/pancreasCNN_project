This repo consists of five source code files that make up the 
pipeline of work: Resample, PatchExtraction, MedianFiltering, Data Augmentation, and Model_build. 

The pipeline begins with the raw CT volume data in the form of '.mhd' files and provides an end-to-end solution model builder for the stratification of these volumes into high and low risk malignancy. 

The pipeline is illustrated in figures/currentpipeline.

The source code is saved as jupyter notebooks to show the output of each script, since the data is private and may not be released.
